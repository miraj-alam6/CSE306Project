Assignment specification was "Put something interesting 
in this file for me to read" so I have written a poetic
short story that will change your life forever.

The caterpillar wanted to fly up to the Window that lie above
him. His mother told him he could do it one day, when he 
became a butterfly. And so the caterpillar waited. He closed 
himself in a cocoon, getting closer each day to his goal.
But before he could emerge with Wings, a 5 year old child
stepped on him, crushing the cocoon, crushing the dreams, and
crushing the dreamer that lived within.
